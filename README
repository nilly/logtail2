logtail2: 

Print log file lines that has not been read since last run. This is another
implementaion of the famous logtail file utility. This program is written in
C (the original logtail is a Perl-script).

If -c is used or logtail2 is invoked as logtail, then is enables logtail
compatibility mode where is saves the offset file next to the logfile it
tails.
