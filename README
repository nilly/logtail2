** GENERAL:

   Print log file lines that has not been read since last run. This is a
   replacement for the logtail utility distributed in the logcheck package. 
   This logtail is implemented in the C-language to be used on system 
   where perl(1) for some reason is not wanted or can't be installed.

** INSTALLATION:

   See INSTALL for a complete tutorial. The short answer:
   
     ./configure
     make
     make install

** COMPATIBILITY:

   Command line options:
   ----------------------
   The command line options includes the logtail compatible options as a
   subset in addition. Fully compatible mode is providing by running
   logtail2 with the '-c' option *or* invoking logtail2 as logtail (i.e.
   thru a symbolic link or a shell wrapper).
   
   Exit codes:
   ----------------------
   The same exit codes as logtail are used. The following exit codes are
   extensions:
   
     80 - failed allocate memory.
     81 - program argument error.
     82 - failed lookup user information.
   
** OFFSET FILES:

   The format of the offset file are the same as that used by logtail.

   Compatibility mode:
   ----------------------   
   When running in compatibility mode, the offset files gets saved as
   logfile.offset unless the '-o' option is used.
   
   Native mode (logtail2):
   ----------------------
   The offset files are saved under /var/cache/logtail2 when runned by root
   and under ~/.logtail2 when runned by an ordinary user. The default
   location of the offset file can be overridden by using the '-o' option.
